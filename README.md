# ML Advanced Models: Random Forest, Neural Networks, PCA, and Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my work for **Problem Set 3** of my Machine Learning course.  
The focus of this assignment is on **advanced supervised and unsupervised learning methods**, covering:
- **Random Forest (RF)**
- **Neural Networks (MLP)**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
This project explores how ensemble methods improve classification, how neural networks handle complex patterns, and how unsupervised techniques uncover hidden structures in data.

## 📊 Methods and Techniques
### **1️⃣ Random Forest (RF)**
- An **ensemble learning method** that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions.
- Uses **bootstrap aggregation (bagging)** to improve generalization.
- **Feature importance analysis** to determine influential variables.

### **2️⃣ Neural Networks (Multilayer Perceptron - MLP)**
- Implements a **feedforward neural network** with backpropagation.
- Utilizes **ReLU activation** for hidden layers and **softmax/sigmoid** for output.
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: number of layers, neurons, learning rate.

### **3️⃣ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- A **dimensionality reduction technique** that transforms correlated features into uncorrelated principal components.
- Helps visualize high-dimensional data in **2D/3D space**.

### **4️⃣ t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**
- A **non-linear dimensionality reduction** method used for visualization.
- Captures local structure better than PCA but is computationally expensive.

### **5️⃣ K-Means Clustering**
- A **centroid-based unsupervised learning algorithm** for grouping similar data points.
- Requires specifying `k`, the number of clusters.
- Uses **Elbow Method & Silhouette Score** for optimal cluster selection.

### **6️⃣ Hierarchical Clustering**
- A **tree-based clustering method** that does not require a predefined `k`.
- Builds a **dendrogram** to represent cluster relationships.

### **7️⃣ Model Evaluation Metrics**
- **Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- **Clustering: Silhouette Score, Inertia, Davies-Bouldin Index**
- **Dimensionality Reduction: Variance Explained (PCA)**

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Random Forest outperforms single decision trees** due to ensemble averaging.
- **Neural Networks require careful hyperparameter tuning** to achieve good generalization.
- **PCA reduces dimensionality effectively** while preserving variance, making visualization more interpretable.
- **t-SNE provides better cluster separation** for visualization but is computationally expensive.
- **K-Means performs well when clusters are spherical**, while **Hierarchical Clustering is useful for hierarchical relationships**.
